## Spatial Computing

### 1. Get started with building apps for spatial computing

#### Fundamentals

**Shared Space**
- By default, apps launch into the Shared Space.

**Window**
- Mix 2D and 3D content.
- Reposition a window.

**Volume**
- Display 3D content in defined bounds.
- Reposition volumes and view from different angles.

**Full Space**

ARKit's APIs
- In addtion to system-provided gestures, you can get more detailed Skeletal Hand Tracking.

*Passthrough to ground content in the real world*
- Keep people connected with surroundings

*Fully Immersive Space*

**Interactions**
- Eyes and Hands Input
- Direct Input (touch in 3D space)
- Interactions with RealityKit entities
- Skeletal Hand Tracking
- Wireless Devices

**SharePlay**

**SharedContext**

**Privacy**
- Curated data and interactions
- Clear permissions (scene understanding, skeletal hand tracking etc.)

#### Xcode

Interact with your app by using simulated system gestures.
- Simulator comes with 3 different simulated scenes:
  - Each with day and night lighting.
  -
